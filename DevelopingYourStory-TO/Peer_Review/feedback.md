Audience Identification:

I understand the audience to be President Kim of PHILADELPHIA250. 
Does the president anticipate a recommendation of gateways?
Considering if an audience expects the correspondence can help with framing.

Data Selection and Preparation:

- Do you detail more information about the geographic features? Can they be briefly introduced before being shown on a map? Or are they stand-alone?

<ins>A little in Methodology too</ins>

- Was there some criteria used to filter OpenDataPhilly data?
- Maybe break filtered landmarks into groups of *historical*, *social*, or *culturual* significance
- Did you remove or keep the filtered landmarks?
	-	Which were kept (and why--criteria might answer this)
	-	'Houses of Worship' is in the list and map legend but 'double entries' is understandably in the list only

<ins>Smaller Notes</ins>

- use ODP early on or not at all
- giving a focused sample of one neighborhood and its gateway(s) might be good
(you could also use personal words from people from the area (now or in history) for the narrative

Narrative:

- great description of how a gateway reresents its community
- good link to dot map identifying partners (give it some mention in intro if possible too)
- try putting references to articles/links with the words to keep flow
ex: "..designating it the [n]ation's (first UNESCO World Heritage City)[https://www.phl.org/at-phl/art-exhibitions/digital-art-exhibitions/node322]."
or (*text*)[*link*]

Data Visualization:

- The maps themselves have a good, easily viewable color scheme.
- If possible, give a short synopsis of the dot map selections (or have a picture of the legends alone too)

"This report offers..." could probably be replaced with a direct pronoun and verb.
Past tense and active voice is hard, keep it up.
