Try out that reverse outlining idea 
- write down the topic sentence of each paragraph 
and look at the outline of what's written. 

Does the flow make sense?

Does each paragraph contain a single cohesive idea supported by evidence?

How's the language? 

Do you spot any passive voices?

Any recommendations on the structure? 
Is there a hook? 
Is there some tension? 
Is it boring?

Finally, how are the supporting data visualizations? Any suggestions?
If you need an extra week to wrap up your final product, that is fine. But also, if you'd like to just get it wrapped up before Thanksgiving so you can enjoy your break (and make maps!), feel free to wrap it up.


Kathleen Feedback:

Evening!

Hope youâ€™re having a nice weekend!  Attached are some notes about your storytelling markdown you sent earlier!


NOTES
Audience/Message Planning
- What type of company are you working for?  You list different significant roles that you might address, though it might be helpful to have a more clear picture of the company itself.  Is it a tech startup? A larger, long-time running media company?

The Story
- briefly state why the company wants to move more towards dashboarding and visualizations.
- great proposals!

What should we look for?
- Great description of why python and JS should be considered as targeted/useful languages, rather than other languages

Chart/Visualizations
- i love the color scheme!
- consider renaming the x axis to something like "# of repositories"

Big Idea
- restate big idea to be more direct, include buzzwords
