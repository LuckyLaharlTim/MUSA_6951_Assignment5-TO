In the narrative, I am an employee of a fairly new data journal company named **Intriguin Journalism** and am writing
to the CEO (or someone with the ability to impact the hiring department/HR's operations).
The company has been keeping their number of employees low since the COVID pandemic but has recently been having too few people to perform all the tasks they want.
This has led to a call for new employees and some concern of published visuaizations following the declining quality of those for internal meetings among the team and stockholders.
Having new employees and visualizations should assuage the stockholders and other executives of fears, hence a focus on new ones.


I propose the company raises awareness of applicant GitHub profiles given the technical nature of what the company needs.
The main focus of presented data is on supporting how those that use GitHub are a relevant audience for the company to target for recruitment while presenting the ways that familiarity with the GitHub platform can further realize the audience's core goals.

For the markdown, much of the code provided was unessential to the narrative itself leading to the decision to fold the code. 
The sole exception was a reference to a calculation percentage that was presented to complement a graphic. 
The percentage was knitted into the text using inline code while simple headers and descriptive graphic headers were used otherwise.

I chose to maintain a consistent, minimal theme for the maps and graphs so that the insight would be highlighted. In the case of the map specifically, the state of primary importance to the audience, Pennsylvania, has a different (rust) border color to make finding it easier while allowing nearby states with higher counts to still be easily identifiable. 
References to data and mentioned pages are made available as introduced through links, and I attempt to state the purpose of a graphic before its display or its takeaway in text immediately afterwards.
